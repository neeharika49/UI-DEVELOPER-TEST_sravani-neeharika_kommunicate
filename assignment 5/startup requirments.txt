If i'm gonna start a software company i would choose a person based on their technical and softskills.One of the major aspects I look into in a person who could help by
contributing to the growth of the company would be perseverance and consistency in producing results.Taking this into consideration as my major criteria I would like to choose 
two of my friends who have been a great support to me in this entire B.tech journey and proove themselves very well in this aspect.They would be Kaviyashree.RP,Nishanth kumar.
Kavishree.rp - In the past few years she has worked with a couple of small scale to well known organisations and has given her best in producing results as student intern.
Nishanth Kumar- Throughout the B.Tech years, he has been really consistent in building his technical knowledge and showing perfection towards anything he commits into.
